#### Define a Product Vision

I begin by defining the product's vision.

It's my responsibility to define the vision, but all internal stakeholders will be involved in creating it.

In most cases, this consists of a call/meeting where we discuss the following:

- **Who** are we looking to help with this product?
- **What** problems do we think it will solve?
- **What** will make it different from other products?

I will then create a **vision statement**, which is a short statement that defines the product's long-term goal. This will help guide the product throughout its lifecycle.

> **Example**: _Simplify, centralise, and standardise customer support for small tech companies._
