# Define a Product Vision

I begin by defining the product's vision.

It is my responsibility to define the vision, but all internal stakeholders will be involved in creating it.

In most cases, this consists of a call where we discuss the following:

- **Who** are we looking to help with this product?
- **What** problems do we think it will solve?
- **What** will make it different from other products?

(Note: The call is generally not as well structured as this list suggests.)

This process leads to the **vision statement**, which is where the magic lies.

It is a short statement that defines the product's long-term goal, which all internal stakeholders have agreed to, and which will guide the rest of the process.

> **Example**: `text-primary` _Simplify, centralise, and standardise customer support for small tech companies._
