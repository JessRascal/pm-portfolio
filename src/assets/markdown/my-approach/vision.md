I begin by defining the <span class="text-primary-light">product's vision</span>.

It's my responsibility to define the vision, but all internal stakeholders will be involved in creating it.

In most cases, this consists of a call/meeting where we discuss the following:

- <span class="text-primary-light">Who</span> are we looking to help with this product?
- <span class="text-primary-light">What</span> problems do we think it will solve?
- <span class="text-primary-light">How</span> will it be different from other products?

I will then create a <span class="text-primary-light">vision statement</span> which is a short statement that defines the product's long-term goal. This will help guide the product throughout its lifecycle.

> **Example**: _Simplify, centralise, and standardise customer support for small tech companies._
