#### User and Market Research

Next up is understanding the customers' processes, their pain points, and what solutions are available.

This is probably the most important step in the whole process. I believe itâ€™s critical to understand what the customer is trying to achieve and what problems they are facing.

The techniques I use to identify these things can vary based on the product, customer, etc, but I will generally do the following:

- Customer interviews
- Stakeholder workshops
- Surveys
- Shadowing/site visits
- Competitor Analysis
