# Customer/User Research

Next up is understanding the customers processes and pain points.

This is probably the most critical step in the whole process because itâ€™s so important to truly understand what the customer is trying to achieve and what problems they are facing.

The techniques I use to identify these things can vary based on the product, customer, etc, but they will usually involve some or all of the following:

- Customer interviews
- Stakeholder workshops
- Surveys
- Shadowing/site visits

`Call this "product research" and include market research such as competitor analysis?`
