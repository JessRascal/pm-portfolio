We could potentially start receiving feedback within minutes in the form of questions (hopefully not bugs) and I will usually be the first point of contact for these.

Going forward though, we will <span class="text-primary-light">gather feedback</span> that I will review and I will also be <span class="text-primary-light">tracking the success metrics</span> that I defined earlier.

This feedback and the metrics will be used to influence future iterations of the product and help us keep on track for achieving our product vision.
