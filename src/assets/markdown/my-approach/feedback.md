#### Gather Feedback and Track Metrics

We can potentially start receiving feedback within minutes in the form of questions (hopefully not bugs) and I will usually be the first point of contact for these.

Going forward though, we will gather feedback that I will review and I will also be tracking the success metrics I defined earlier.

This feedback and the metrics will be used to influence future iterations of the product and help us keep on track for achieving our product vision.
