Now that I’ve figured out the general layout with my wireframes, it’s time to make things look more like the end product by creating the **high-fidelity mockups**.

I will then look to create an **interactive prototype** with the mockups which is a lot quicker (and cheaper) than getting the development team to develop one.

Once we have the prototype, we can then show it to some users...
