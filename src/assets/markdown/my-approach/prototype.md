#### Create the Mockups / Prototype

Now that I’ve figured out the general layout with my wireframes, it’s time to make things look pretty by creating the high-fidelity mockups.

Luckily these days, it’s not too much of a leap to go from mockups to a prototype that users can interact.

This is so much better (and cheaper) than developing a prototype before we are able to get feedback from the customer/users.
