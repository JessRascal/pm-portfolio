Now that I’ve figured out the general layout with my wireframes, it’s time to make things look more like the end product by creating the <span class="text-primary-light">high-fidelity mockups</span>.

I will then look to create an <span class="text-primary-light">interactive prototype</span> with the mockups which is a lot quicker (and cheaper) than getting the development team to develop one.

Once we have the prototype, we can then show it to some users...
