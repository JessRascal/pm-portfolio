# Carry Out User Testing / Validation

Now that we have a high-fidelity interactive prototype (let’s just call it “prototype” going forward), we are able to get it in front of users and collect accurate feedback on the design.

The aim during this step is to collect this feedback, go back to the previous step to iterate on the prototype, and then gather feedback on the new version of the prototype.

We repeat this until we feel confident that the design is right.
