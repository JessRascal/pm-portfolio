#### Carry Out User Testing / Validation

Now that we have a high-fidelity interactive prototype (let’s just call it a “prototype” going forward), we are able to get it in front of some users and collect accurate feedback to validate the design.

This process consists of the following:

- Have the users try the prototype
- Gather feedback
- Iterate on the design based on the feedback

We will repeat the above until we are confident enough with the design to move forward.
