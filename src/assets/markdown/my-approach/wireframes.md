#### Create the Wireframes

I find it’s best to start simple by creating low-fidelity designs in the form of wireframes.

These help me make sense of my initial idea, dismiss the bad ones, and figure out the general layout that forms the basis for the next step.

> Fun fact: At times I’ll even use good ol’ pen and paper to create the wireframes!
