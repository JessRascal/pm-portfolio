The items in the product roadmap need to be broken down into small chunks by creating **user stories** for each.

I write each user story in plain English so that it is easily understood by all stakeholders. I also like to stick to a strict **who**/**what**/**why** format.

> **Example**: _As a customer support agent, I want to be able to only see my open tickets so that I can focus on what I currently have outstanding._

I will also include acceptance criteria for each which will be in the format of true statements that can be “ticked off” to confirm when the user story is "done".

With input from the stakeholders, I will prioritise these user stories in a list to create the **Product Backlog** which will be regularly reviewed within **backlog refinement meetings**.
