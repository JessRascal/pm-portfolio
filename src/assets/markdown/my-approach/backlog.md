#### Create a Product Backlog

The high-level features identified in the last step now need to be broken down into small chunks by creating user stories.

My aim for each user story is to make it as concise as possible so that’s it’s easy to understand and that’s why I use a strict **who** / **what** / **why** format.

> **Example**: _As a customer support agent, I want to be able to view only my open tickets so that I can focus on what I currently have outstanding._

I will then include the acceptance criteria for each user story that will be in the form of a list of true statements that can be “ticked off” to confirm the user story is done.

These user stories form the product backlog which I will continue to prioritise as we move forward.
