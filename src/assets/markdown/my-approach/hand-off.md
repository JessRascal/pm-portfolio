#### Hand-Off to the Development Team

I will now brief the development team on what we are looking to create as we carry out our **Sprint Planning Meeting**.

As a team, we will review the user stories, create tasks with estimated durations, and then decide what we can complete in the first/next sprint.

Seen as the development team will have been involved in various steps up until this point, there shouldnâ€™t be any major surprises about what we are planning to develop.
