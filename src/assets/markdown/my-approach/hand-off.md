#### Hand-Off to the Development Team

It's now time for the development team to take the lead.

As a team we carry out a **Sprint Planning Meeting** where we review the user stories (in priority order), create tasks to get the work done with estimated times, and then decide what we can complete in the next sprint.

Seen as the development team will have been involved in various steps up until this point, there shouldnâ€™t be any major surprises about what we are planning to develop.
