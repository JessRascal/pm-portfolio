It's now time for the development team to take the lead.

To get them started, we have a **Sprint Planning Meeting** where we:

- Review the user stories in priority order
- Create tasks with estimated times for each user story
- Decide what can be completed in the first/next sprint

Since the development team will have been involved in some of the previous steps, there shouldnâ€™t be any major surprises about what we are planning to develop.
