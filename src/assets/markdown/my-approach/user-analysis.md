# Customer/User Analysis

Collecting all of the qualitative and quantitate research data in the last step is great, but it’s not much use if I don’t take the time to understand it.

To do this, I will create things like:

- Process maps
- Customer/User personas
- Customer/user journey maps
- Empathy maps

Creating these types of documents helps me make sense of the research data, but they are also great tools for explaining things to the stakeholders.
