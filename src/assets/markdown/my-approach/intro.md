In the following slides, I describe my general end-to-end approach for taking a new product from idea to delivery.

Obviously, every product is unique with a lot of variables, but hopefully this will give you an idea of how I approach things.

Some things to keep in mind:

- I reference creating a new product throughout (including in the above) but I apply a similar approach to new features for an existing product.
- I've structured my approach in phases and steps, but in reality things aren't always so linear.
- I use "customer" and "user" interchangably here, even though that's not necessarily the case.

So on to step 1...
