# Introduction

- Mention **user/customers** (explain my definitions and then stick to this throughout the steps).
- Mention trying to give a structure but there are overlaps(particularly between discovery and design).
- Mention how the process I describe is mainly focused on creating a new product but my approach is similar when creating a new feature for an existing product(just avoiding having to write “product/feature” everywhere)....
