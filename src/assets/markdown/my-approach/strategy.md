# Create a Product Strategy

Ok, now that I know what I’m dealing with, it’s time to figure out a strategy to achieve the product vision.

A big part of defining the strategy is identifying the key high-level features that will be required and documenting them in a product roadmap.

Another crucial part of the strategy step is defining success metrics (KPIs) so that I can track to make sure we are heading in the right direction (i.e. towards our product vision).

Success metrics should be specific to the product, but here are some examples:

- 5 new company registrations in 6 months
- Annual recurring revenue
- Daily active users (DAU)
- Net promoter score (NPS)
