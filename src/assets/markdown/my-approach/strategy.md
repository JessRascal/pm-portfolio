Now that I know what we're dealing with, itâ€™s time to figure out a strategy to help us work towards the product vision.

A big part of defining the strategy is identifying the key high-level features that will be required and then prioritising them within a **product roadmap**.

Another crucial part is defining success metrics (KPIs) that can be tracked to make sure we are heading in the right direction.

- Daily active users (DAU)
- Net promoter score (NPS)
