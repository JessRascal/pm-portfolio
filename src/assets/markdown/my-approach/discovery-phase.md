#### Product Discovery Phase

For any new product or feature, I start out with the discovery phase.

This is where I aim to figure out if we should pursue the idea or scrap it and get a coffee instead.

My main focus throughout this is if we can help solve someone’s problems, but also if it’s worth us pursuing as a business (i.e. can it generate revenue).
