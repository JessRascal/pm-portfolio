This is a bespoke application that was designed and developed for a large public sector railway company. Its goal is to assist in making sure track workers have a valid safe system of work in place.

#### Problem

For the iterations that I have worked on, the key problem areas that the client was facing were:

- New industry standards and procedures being introduced that the app needed to incorporate
- A high workload for their internal support team in regard to user management
- Performance issues due to the large number of records

#### My Role

I was brought in as the **product manager** to lead the first major iteration since the apps initial release and I have continued in that role since.

I implemented an agile approach and worked with the internal and external stakeholders to make sure they understood this new framework and could see the value in it.

A big focus of mine was to understand the complicated industry-specific processes that the client was carrying out and then make sure the development team understood them

#### Outcome

- The client has been using this app in production for over 10 years
- 15 million+ safe systems of work have been created using the app
- There are over `???` active users (`Daily? Weekly? Monthly?`)
- This app has generated millions in revenue for our company `Can I say this?`
