Ops Suite is a collection of web apps that are specifically designed to assist railway maintenance companies with their planning, resourcing, and delivering of work on the UK rail infrastructure.

#### Problem

The client was facing **issues with sharing up-to-date information** across their different departments. This was leading to instances of people working from outdated data.

They also had problems with **time-consuming manual processes** such as managing their workload and machine maintenance schedules. This was having a major financial impact.

Another area of concern was making sure they were sticking to the terms and conditions of their employees' contracts when it came to assigning them to jobs.

#### My Role

As the **product manager** and **designer**, I worked closely with the customer to understand their existing processes and identify their problems.

I used this information to formulate a product strategy that included creating and maintaining a product roadmap to make sure we were working towards our product’s vision.

Throughout the delivery phase, I worked closely with the development team to assist with technical challenges.

#### Outcome

- The apps have been in production for over 4 years
- They are used by over `???` active users (`Daily? Weekly? Monthly?`)
- `Number of work orders per week???`
- `Managing the maintenance of X machines???`
- We continue to rollout to additional business units within the customer’s business
- We are also looking to rollout these applications out to other companies in the near future
- This suite of applications now forms a substantial part of our company’s annual recurring revenue (ARR)
