# Ops Suite Mobile

This will be a native mobile app that will be an addition to our Ops Suite. It will be targeted specifically towards railway maintenance site workers.

#### Problem

Our [Ops Suite](/case-studies/ops-suite.html) apps are primarily focused around the planning of work that is carried out within the office.

This means there are still some inefficient processes that need to be addressed, primarily regarding the people carrying out the work on site.

We are still working on understanding their processes and identifying their key problems.

#### My Role

As the **product manager**, I am currently focused on recruitment so that I can put together the required team to move forward with this product.

`Include what my role will be?`

#### Outcome

Coming soon.
