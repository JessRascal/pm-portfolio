**Nudge** will be a customer support solution aimed at small businesses that need to provide efficient support but donâ€™t have dedicated support staff.

This is a side project of mine.

#### Problem

For years I have had the responsibility of providing hands-on customer support for our products even though my role is primarily **product manager**.

There is not enough of a support workload to justify having dedicated support staff, however, we still want to provide a good support service to our users.

I have found that the existing customer support solutions out there tend to be overly complicated with a big learning curve and are overkill for what we need.

#### My Role

I am currently working solo on this project and therefore I am carrying out the roles of **product manager**, **designer**, **developer**, **solution architect**, **marketing manager**, etc.

Currently my main focus is confirming that other companies face the same problems that I have detailed above.

You can read about my progress on my [blog](https://medium.com/@JessRascal/list/nudge-app-progress-07b575c2f50c).

#### Outcome

Coming soon.
